 Assignment 2

 Develop an algorithm/mechanism for a best-effort network-wide broadcast.
 The approach is to propagate a packet to nodes using simple flooding. 
 For each broadcast, the system should, eventually, reach a steady silent state where nodes stop transmitting packets. 
 To achieve this, duplicate packets should be handled appropriately.
 Your mechanism should also try to avoid collisions that might occur 
 if two or more nodes that are in range of each other attempt to transmit a packet simultaneously. 
 This is especially important given that the radio support of the sensor nodes is rather simple 
 (there are no sophisticated collision detection/avoidance schemes).

 Evaluate your algorithm in TOSSIM for different network topologies (chain, tree, grid), different number of nodes, 
 and different number of concurrent sources. Use an application issues a broadcast periodically. 
 For each case, record (i) the actual per-node transmissions, (ii) the total number of transmissions, 
 (iii) the average per-node transmissions, (iv) the coverage (number of nodes that received a given message), 
 and (v) the minimum, average and maximum message latency.
 
 Develop a simple application that uses the mechanism to propagate to the network every message it receives over the serial port
 
 Staging

 1. Develop and test your flooding mechanism using TOSSIM
 2. Develop code that receives a packet from the serial port
 3. Add code to transmit the received packet via the broadcast mechanism
 4. Add your flooding algorithm 

 Hints

 Read carefully the radio communication tutorial
 Think how to use the LEDs of the nodes in order to visualize the state of the system during real trials, 
 in a practical way that is easy to observe.
 Try to see how well randomness works vs more deterministic back-off algorithms.
 Note that when using TOSSIM all nodes will run the same code/firmware. 
 Node-specific behavior in the simulations can be achieved by introducing branches in the code, based on the local node identifier.
